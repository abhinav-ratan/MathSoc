# Quant Internship Session - Q&A

## Info and Motivation

**Q: What motivated you to pursue an internship in Quant, compared to other roles such as software?**
- The job description was interesting, and I loved mathematics with motivation from hostel seniors.
- Quant is attractive due to its statistics and ML-intensive nature.
- Quant is more finance-oriented, providing an opportunity to explore the field.

**Q: Can you elaborate on the various types of Quant firms beyond high-frequency trading?**
- Bartleys and JPMC offer unique finance roles.
- Hedge funds like Jane Street focus on proprietary trading.

**Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of pursuing a career in Quant in India vs Abroad?**
- Abroad: New culture and travel, less company.
- India: Save more of your stipend due to lower living expenses abroad.

**Q: What are the critical differences between quant traders, researchers, and developers?**
- Developers must develop trading software, build tech stacks, and reduce latency.
- Traders do actual trading and research to develop trading strategies.

**Q: What factors contributed to the superior performance of Quant small-cap investments over the past five years compared to other investment strategies in India?**

**Q: What is the likelihood or conversion rate for obtaining a (PPO) after completing an internship?**
- Around 50% PPO conversion rate. In Quadeye, for example, all IITD interns got a PPO.
- Varies from batch to batch and company to company (depends on funds available).

**Q: How can individuals from non-circuital branches go into quant roles?**
- Maths students have more preference than CS students for finance firms.
- Companies like Da Vinci and Optiver expect good mathematics or CF ratings like 2200.
- Bartleys, Goldman Sachs, and shifting to HFT are also possible.

## Work

**Q: Can you share some details about the projects you were engaged in and how day-to-day work was like?**
- Riya: Developed a Python module for systems and a Quantitative research project.
- Laksh: Worked on prediction projects using ML techniques for price movement.
- Yashas: Trading intern with lectures and simulated trading sessions.
- Tushar: Allotted a low-frequency equity trading stream and asked to develop profit-making strategies.

**Q: How has knowledge of finance proven beneficial in your role?**
- Some knowledge of finance, like derivatives and courses in Financial Maths, can be helpful.
- Finance knowledge during interviews can help show interest in the field.

**Q: How flexible is the transition between roles, particularly from a trader or researcher position to a developer role?**
- Limited scope for interns, more flexibility for experienced individuals.
- Example: At Tower Research, undergraduates first work as developers, then shift to trading roles.

**Q: What was the background of your colleagues and seniors working at the firm (say branch)?**
- Diverse backgrounds, including IITD, BITS, and specializations or Ph.D.s in mathematics, statistics, etc.
- Graviton and Quadeye mostly have IIT people.
- Companies abroad have people from varied backgrounds like pure maths, economics, etc.

## Preparation

**Q: When do you believe is the optimal time to start preparing for a career in quantitative finance?**
- During summer break, proficiency in Competitive Programming is crucial.
- Mathematics preparation with resources like Brainstellar, Xinfang Xao book, etc., during the end of 2nd year.
- CP is necessary for programming tests and improving mental ability.
- MTL106 and basic probability are essential for mathematics tests.
- CGPA is crucial, try maintaining it above 9, and 9.5+ is considered the best!

**Q: Can you share your preparation strategy or specific courses or resources you found helpful?**
- Quant: Heard on the street, Xinfeng book (ch. 2,4,5), Brain stellar, MTL390, Some ML background, Quant Guide, Mental Maths(App), 50 challenging problems in maths.
- Coding: Codeforces, CSES, Code Chef (All div), Leetcode (company-specific).
- Don’t miss critical quant-related competitions like World Quant.

**Q: Do you consider previous knowledge in machine learning to be a prerequisite for a Quant Job?**
- Quant firms don’t ask ML in interviews, but ML helps during internships.

**Q: How can one compensate for a lower CGPA when seeking a quant internship?**

- CGPA criteria are not crucial to firms like Optiver or Da Vinci.

**Q: Can you provide insights into the different stages and specific areas evaluated during the interview rounds in Quant firms?**
- The first interview was mostly MTL106 stuff like Covariance.
- 2nd round was difficult, covering topics like calculating sqrt(7) without paper, brain teasers, or mental maths.
- You get to interview for only five roles, with each company having 2-3 rounds.
- Communication skills are important. If you don’t know a question, be honest, share your work, and ask for help.
- Resilience is important, so be confident in your answers if you believe they are correct.
